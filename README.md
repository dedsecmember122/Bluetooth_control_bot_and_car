# Bluetooth_control_bot_and_car
I made a project of bot/rover which can be used in various sector for example - Health, Manufacturing, Service and etc.
It is code of bot which can be control by your phone. 
If you want to go light on pocket it is a best module for controlling motors.
Even easier than NRF24l01 module. 
Materials required - Arduino board , L293d motor driver , Hc05 bluetooth module , motors and android phone to control .
Just simply need to Download app called - bluetooth Rc control. 
thank you for visiting my Project.
